- Commas: `Add skill Python, Java, C++`
- "and": `Add skill Python and Java and C++`
- Semicolons: `Add skill Python; Java; C++`

### 3. **Quote Flexibility**
Works with or without quotes:
- `Add publication title: Deep Learning`
- `Add publication title: "Deep Learning"`
- `Add publication title: 'Deep Learning'`

### 4. **Context-Aware**
The AI understands context:
- "title" in publication context = publication title
- "title" in profile context = professional title

### 5. **Auto-Synchronization**
- Updating individual publication citations auto-recalculates total
- Adding/deleting publications updates publication count
- All related metrics stay in sync
